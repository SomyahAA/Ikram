The interviewed person above did sign a consent form before starting the interview. The interview took about 5-10 minutes. The interview began with a general question for icebreaking, which helped get more information from the person interviewed. One of the general questions the interviewed person liked the most and seem to have helped so much in the interview was “What do you do in your Leisure time,” where he mentioned his love for reading and learning programming in his free time. When the interviewed person was asked about “What are your goals in life or wisdom in life,” The person answered by, “Nothing last forever.” This answer gave a great sense of how the other questions are going to be answered. Furthermore, when asking the interviewed person about his shopping habits, the interview person indicated that he is the type of people who like shopping and buying expensive thing. However, when he was asked what he would do with the expensive things that he no longer need, the interviewed answer that he would give it to his family and secondly would donate it.
